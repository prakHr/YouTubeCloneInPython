# YouTubeCloneInPython
made a slightly twistful youtube clone in python using dash and react components in very less amount of time that uses all of the concepts of frontend like lazy loading, state management, less time that directly affects responsiveness and pagination along with basics of DSA.

# Points Mastered and to be remembered for future use case while making a front-end UI

1. Use concepts of 
* lazy loading
* state management
* fast responsiveness
* pagination
* smooth Integration with APIs in this case using UTube API using DSA, not just brute-forcing everything.

2. Dont just make a clone, evolve from it and become tony stark in future journey.

3. Try to simplify everything if possible.

# Where to go from here ie future homework if time permits?

1. Integrate firebase authentication using email and password in dash app.
2. Add other non essential components to it as well.
3. Add a beautiful loader or progress bar whichever you prefer.
